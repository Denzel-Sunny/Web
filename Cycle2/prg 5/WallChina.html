    <p>The Great Wall of China is a series of frotifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and the Imperical China
      as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches
      later joined by Qin Shi Huang(220-206 BC),the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
      multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368â€“1644).
